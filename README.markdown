No Jasper is a *Caves of Qud* mod that puts a curse on the sheaf of tattered parchment, which can be found in the waterlogged tunnel and other places. The curse is activated by reading the parchment.

There is no mechanical upside to this mod. This is not a challenge mod. It only makes the game worse.

This version of this mod was tested with Caves of Qud version 2.0.203.33.
